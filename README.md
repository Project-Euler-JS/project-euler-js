Solutions to Project Euler problems (1 to 100) in JavaScript.

## Introduction
This repository contains solutions to the first 100 problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in JavaScript. Each problem is solved using an efficient algorithm and well-commented code to explain the approach used.

## Project Euler Overview
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. The goal is to develop efficient algorithms to solve the problems in a limited time.

In this repository, I've solved problems 1 through 100. These solutions aim to be both accurate and efficient. Some problems require mathematical insights, while others focus on algorithmic complexity and optimization.

## Solution Structure
Each problem has its own JavaScript file. The solutions are numbered according to the problem number (e.g., `problem_1.js`, `problem_2.js`, etc.). Inside each file, the solution for that specific problem is provided with a brief explanation of the approach used to solve it.

### Example:
- `problem_1.js`: Solution for Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5
- `problem_2.js`: Solution for Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
- `problem_3.js`: Solution for Problem 3 - Largest prime factor
- ...

## How to Run the Solutions

To run the solutions locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/david15tonon/project-euler-js.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-euler-js
   ```

3. **Run a solution (example with Problem 1):**
   You can run a specific problem file using Node.js. For example, to run Problem 1:
   ```bash
   node problem_1.js
   ```

4. **Install Node.js if needed:**
   If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
